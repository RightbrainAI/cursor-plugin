# Rightbrain Task Manager

A comprehensive skill for managing Rightbrain tasks. Create new tasks following best practices, browse and run existing tasks, update configurations, and export/import task definitions.

> **CLI note:** All operations use the `npx rightbrain@latest` CLI, which handles authentication, token refresh, and org/project selection automatically. No manual token management is needed.

## Core Principles

### 1. Stateless Execution
Every task run is independent—no memory of previous runs. All context must be passed as input.

### 2. Single Responsibility
One task does one thing well. If your description contains "and then" or "also", split it into multiple tasks.

### 3. Structured Outputs
Tasks return predictable, typed outputs. Use `output_format` to define the exact structure.

---

## Workflow

### Context Tracking

Throughout this workflow, you must track these values across phases:
- `ORG_ID` - Selected organization UUID
- `PROJECT_ID` - Selected project UUID
- `TASK_ID` - Currently selected task UUID (when applicable)

These values are used in subsequent CLI commands. Store them in your reasoning context as you progress through the workflow.

---

### Phase 0: Authentication & Setup

Before any operations, establish credentials and select the working context. The CLI handles token management automatically.

**Exit option:** At any point in this phase, if the user says "cancel", "exit", or "never mind", exit the skill gracefully with: "No problem! Run this skill again when you're ready to work with Rightbrain tasks."

#### Step 1: Check Authentication Status

Check if the user is authenticated:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest whoami
```

**If command succeeds** (shows user info, org, and project): Authentication is valid. Extract the org and project from the output and proceed to Step 3.

**If command fails** (error or "not logged in"): Go to Step 2 (Login).

#### Step 2: Login

The user hasn't authenticated yet. Tell them what's about to happen, then run the login:

```
You're not authenticated with Rightbrain yet. Let's get you set up!

I'll open your browser to sign in — no API keys needed.
```

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest login --non-interactive
```

This will open the user's browser to sign in. After authentication, credentials are stored in `~/.rightbrain/credentials.json`.

**If login succeeds:** Run `npx rightbrain@latest whoami` to confirm, then proceed to Step 3.

**If login fails** (command exits with an error):
```
Login didn't complete. You can try running `npx rightbrain@latest login` manually in your terminal, then let me know when you're done.
```
Exit skill gracefully.

#### Step 3: Select Organization & Project

If `whoami` showed an org and project already selected, confirm with the user and skip to Step 4.

If org or project need to be set, fetch the available organizations:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest list-orgs --json
```

**If 0 organizations:**
```
You don't have any organizations yet.
Create one at: https://app.rightbrain.ai
```
Exit skill gracefully.

**If 1 organization:**
Auto-select and confirm:
```
Using your organization: {org_name} ({org_id})
```

**If multiple organizations:**
Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "Which organization do you want to work with?"
- Header: "Organization"
- Options: List each org as "{name}" with description showing the org ID

Then fetch projects for the selected organization:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest list-projects --json
```

**If 0 projects:**
```
This organization has no projects yet.
Create one at: https://app.rightbrain.ai
```
Exit skill gracefully.

**If 1 project:**
Auto-select and confirm:
```
Using your project: {project_name} ({project_id})
```

**If multiple projects:**
Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "Which project do you want to work with?"
- Header: "Project"
- Options: List each project as "{name}" with description showing the project ID

After selecting, set the CLI context:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest switch-project --org-id {ORG_ID} --project-id {PROJECT_ID}
```

#### Step 4: Prefetch Available Models (for Create/Import flows)

After org and project are established, fetch available models:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest list-models --json
```

Store the model list in context. Key fields to note:
- `id`: UUID for `llm_model_id`
- `name`: Human-readable name (e.g., "GPT-4o", "Claude 3.5 Sonnet")
- `supports_vision`: Required for image tasks

This prefetch prevents users from designing a task only to discover their preferred model isn't available.

---

### Phase 1: Choose Action

After selecting organization and project, present the main action menu.

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "What would you like to do?"
- Header: "Action"
- Options:
  - **Create new task** - Design a new Rightbrain task from scratch
  - **Browse existing tasks** - View, run, update, or export tasks
  - **Import task from file** - Load a task configuration from JSON file

**If "Create new task":** Proceed to [Task Design Workflow](#task-design-workflow-create-new-task)

**If "Browse existing tasks":** Proceed to [Task Browser](#task-browser)

**If "Import task from file":** Proceed to [Import Task Configuration](#import-task-configuration)

---

## Task Browser

### Fetch Tasks

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest list-tasks --json
```

### Display Task List

**If 0 tasks:**
```
This project has no tasks yet. Would you like to create one?
```
Offer to proceed to task creation.

**If tasks exist:**
Format each task as a summary for display:

```
{name}
  {description (first 80 chars)}...
  Modality: {output_modality} | Status: {enabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled"}
```

Use AskUserQuestion to let user select a task:
- Question: "Select a task to manage:"
- Header: "Task"
- Options: List each task with name as label and summary as description
- Include a final option: "Create new task" - Start fresh with a new task design

### Task Actions

After selecting a task, present the action menu:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "What would you like to do with '{task_name}'?"
- Header: "Task action"
- Options:
  - **Run task** - Execute with input values
  - **Update task** - Modify prompts, model, or output format
  - **Export task** - Save configuration to file
  - **View details** - See full task configuration
  - **Back** - Return to task list

---

## Run Task Flow

### Step 1: Fetch Task Details

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest get-task --task {TASK_ID} --json
```

### Step 2: Parse Input Variables

Extract the active revision from the response (look for revision with `active: true`).

Parse the `user_prompt` for `{variable_name}` patterns using regex:
```
\{([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\}
```

Exclude common template patterns that aren't user inputs (like `{variable_1}` placeholders in documentation).

### Step 3: Collect Input Values

For each input variable found, ask the user to provide a value:

```
The task requires the following inputs:

{variable_name}: [inferred description from prompt context]

Please provide a value for {variable_name}:
```

### Step 4: Execute Task

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest run-task --task {TASK_ID} --input variable_1="user_provided_value" --input variable_2="user_provided_value"
```

**Critical:** Each input variable is passed as a separate `--input name=value` flag.

### Step 5: Display Results

On success, display:
- The task output (`response` field)
- Token usage summary
- Credits consumed
- Link to view in dashboard: `https://app.rightbrain.ai/task/{task_id}/run?id={task_run_id}`

On failure, show the error and suggest fixes based on the error type.

### Step 6: Post-Run Menu

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "Task completed. What next?"
- Header: "Next action"
- Options:
  - **Run again** - Same task with new inputs
  - **Different task** - Return to task browser
  - **Done** - Exit skill

**If "Run again":** Return to Step 3 (Collect Input Values)

**If "Different task":** Return to [Task Browser](#task-browser)

**If "Done":** Exit skill with summary of what was accomplished

---

## Update Existing Task

### Step 1: Fetch Current Configuration

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest get-task --task {TASK_ID} --json
```

### Step 2: Display Current Configuration

Extract the active revision and show:

```
Current Task Configuration:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Name: {name}
Description: {description}
Model: {llm_model.name}
Temperature: {llm_config.temperature}
Output Modality: {output_modality}

System Prompt:
{system_prompt}

User Prompt:
{user_prompt}

Output Format:
{output_format as formatted JSON}
```

### Step 3: Collect Updates

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "What would you like to update?"
- Header: "Update"
- Options:
  - **System prompt** - Modify the AI's role and behavior
  - **User prompt** - Modify instructions and input variables
  - **Output format** - Change the structured output schema
  - **Model settings** - Change model or temperature
  - **Multiple fields** - I'll specify several changes
  - **Cancel** - Return without changes

Based on selection, guide user through the specific update:
- For prompts: Show current value, ask for new value
- For model: Fetch available models and let user choose
- For output format: Guide through schema modification

### Step 4: Submit Update

**Important:** Updates create a new task revision. The new revision is **NOT** automatically active—you must explicitly activate it or run with the specific revision ID.

Write the update fields to a YAML file, then submit:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest update-task --task {TASK_ID} --file updates.yaml
```

Only include fields that were changed.

The response will include the new revision with `"active": false`. Note the new `revision_id`.

### Step 5: Activate the New Revision

After creating a new revision, you have two options:

**Option A: Activate the revision (recommended for permanent changes)**

Submit the update with the `--activate` flag to make the new revision active immediately:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest update-task --task {TASK_ID} --file updates.yaml --activate
```

This makes the new revision the default for all future runs.

**Option B: Run with specific revision (for testing)**

Use the `--revision` flag to test before activating:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest run-task --task {TASK_ID} --revision {NEW_REVISION_ID} --input variable_1="value"
```

**Why this matters:**
- Creating a new revision does NOT automatically make it active
- Without activating or specifying `--revision`, the task runs using the previously active revision
- Use Option B to test, then Option A to make permanent

### Step 6: Confirm Update

On success:
```
Task updated successfully!
New revision ID: {revision_id}

Testing the update now with the new revision...
```

Then immediately run the task with the new revision to verify the changes work as expected.

---

## Export Task Configuration

### Step 1: Export Task

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest export-task --task {TASK_ID} --output ./tasks/{task-name-kebab}.json
```

The CLI automatically:
- Fetches the task and its active revision
- Strips internal fields (IDs, timestamps)
- Converts `llm_model_id` to `llm_model_name` for portability
- Adds export metadata (`_export_version`, `_exported_at`, `_source_project`)

### Step 2: Confirm Export

Ask user for export path (default: `./tasks/{task-name-kebab}.json`). Convert task name to kebab-case for filename (lowercase, spaces to hyphens).

Confirm:
```
Task exported successfully!
File: ./tasks/{filename}.json

You can import this task to any project using the import function.
```

---

## Import Task Configuration

### Step 1: Read Import File

Ask user for file path:
```
Please provide the path to the task configuration file:
```

Read and parse the JSON file.

### Step 2: Validate Configuration

1. Check `_export_version` for compatibility (currently "1.0")
2. Validate required fields exist: `name`, `system_prompt`, `user_prompt`, `output_modality`
3. Validate `output_format` matches modality rules

If validation fails, show specific error and exit.

### Step 3: Resolve Model

The export contains `llm_model_name`. Fetch available models and find matching UUID:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest list-models --json
```

Search for model by name (case-insensitive match on `name` or `internal_name`).

**If model found:** Use its `id` as `llm_model_id`

**If model NOT found:**
```
The model '{llm_model_name}' is not available in this project.
```
Use AskUserQuestion to let user select an alternative model from available options.

### Step 4: Check for Name Conflicts

Fetch existing tasks and check if name already exists:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest list-tasks --json
```

Filter the results to check for duplicate names.

**If duplicate exists:**
Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "A task named '{name}' already exists. What should I do?"
- Header: "Conflict"
- Options:
  - **Use different name** - I'll provide a new name
  - **Auto-rename** - Create as "{name} (imported)"
  - **Cancel import** - Don't import this task

### Step 5: Create Task

Transform import config to a YAML file for task creation:
- Replace `llm_model_name` with resolved `llm_model_id`
- Remove export metadata fields (`_export_version`, `_exported_at`, `_source_project`, `_notes`)

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest create-task --file task.yaml --direct
```

### Step 6: Confirm Import

On success:
```
Task imported successfully!
Task ID: {task_id}

View and configure in dashboard: https://app.rightbrain.ai/task/{task_id}/run
(Access token available in task settings)

Note: If this task used RAG or task forwarding, you'll need to reconfigure those settings in the dashboard.
```

## Task Design Workflow (Create New Task)

This is the original task creation workflow for designing new tasks from scratch.

### Phase 1: Discovery

Start by understanding what the user wants to accomplish:

**Questions to ask:**
1. "What problem are you trying to solve?"
2. "What inputs will you have available?"
3. "What outputs do you need to make decisions?"

**Validation checks:**
| Red Flag | Problem | Solution |
|----------|---------|----------|
| "Keep track of..." | Requires state | Pass all context as input each run |
| "Remember the last..." | Needs memory | Use external storage, pass context as input |
| "Update the database..." | Side effects | Return data, handle storage separately |
| "Do X, then Y, then Z" | Multiple responsibilities | Split into separate composable tasks |
| "Analyze this" (vague) | Inconsistent results | Provide specific, directive instructions |

**Single responsibility check:**
If the task goal contains "and then" or "also", suggest splitting:
```
Task 1: "Classify email intent"
Task 2: "Extract dates from email"
Task 3: "Draft reply based on classification"
```

### Phase 2: Input Design

Define what the task receives. Inputs are defined in `user_prompt` using `{variable_name}` syntax.

**Input types:**

| Input Type | Implementation | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Text | `{variable_name}` in user_prompt | Customer message, document text |
| Image | `image_required: true` | Photo analysis, document scanning |
| PDF/DOC | `document_content_extractor` processor | Contract review, invoice parsing |
| URL | `url_fetcher` processor | Web scraping, link analysis |
| Web Search | `perplexity_search` processor | Research, fact-checking |

**Input processor configuration:**
```json
"input_processors": [
  {
    "param_name": "website_content",
    "input_processor": "url_fetcher"
  },
  {
    "param_name": "research_results",
    "input_processor": "perplexity_search",
    "config": {
      "max_results": 5,
      "query_context": "{research_results} latest news and features"
    }
  }
]
```

**Important - Input Processor Data Flow:**
- `param_name` is BOTH the input AND output variable
- The user passes a value for `param_name` (e.g., `{"research_results": "OpenAI"}`)
- The processor uses this value to perform its action (search, fetch, extract)
- The result REPLACES the original value in that same variable
- `query_context` must reference the SAME variable as `param_name`

**Example:** For a competitor analysis task:
```json
{
  "param_name": "research_results",
  "input_processor": "perplexity_search",
  "config": {
    "query_context": "{research_results} AI platform features pricing"
  }
}
```
User calls: `{"competitor_name": "OpenAI", "research_results": "OpenAI"}`
- `{competitor_name}` stays as "OpenAI" (for display in prompt)
- `{research_results}` becomes the Perplexity search results

### Phase 3: Prompt Engineering

Generate well-structured prompts using proven patterns.

**System prompt structure:**
```
You are a [role/expert type] specializing in [domain].

Your expertise includes:
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]

Constraints:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
```

**User prompt structure:**
```
## Goal
[One clear sentence describing what to accomplish]

## Context
[Background information about the task domain]

## Input
{variable_1}: [Description of what this variable contains]
{variable_2}: [Description of what this variable contains]

## Instructions
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Output Requirements
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
```

See [Prompt Patterns Reference](references/prompt-patterns.md) for detailed templates.

### Phase 4: Output Schema Design

Define structured outputs based on the task type. See [Output Formats Reference](references/output-formats.md) for complete documentation.

**Quick reference - Output modalities:**
| Modality | When to Use | `output_format` |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `json` | Structured data, classification | **Required** - define schema |
| `text` | Long-form content | Must be `null` |
| `image` / `audio` / `csv` / `pdf` | Media generation | Must be `null` |

**Common patterns:**

```json
// Enum (constrained choices)
"sentiment": {"type": "str", "options": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"]}

// Nested list
"items": {"type": "list", "item_type": "object", "nested_structure": {"name": "str", "value": "number"}}
```

### Phase 5: Model & Configuration

**Model selection guidance:**
| Task Type | Recommended Model | Temperature |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Classification | Fast model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) | 0.0 - 0.3 |
| Extraction | Accurate model (e.g., GPT-4o) | 0.0 - 0.2 |
| Analysis | Reasoning model (e.g., Claude 3.5) | 0.3 - 0.5 |
| Generation | Creative model | 0.5 - 0.8 |
| Image Output | Image model (e.g., Gemini Flash Image) | 0.6 - 0.8 |

**Fallback model:** Configure `fallback_llm_model_id` for resilience.

**Vision tasks (image input):** Use models with `supports_vision: true`.

**Image generation tasks (image output):** Use models with `supports_image_output: true`. See [Image Generation Guide](references/image-generation.md).

### Phase 6: Generate Configuration

Output a complete, API-ready JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "Task Name",
  "description": "What this task does",
  "enabled": true,
  "output_modality": "json",
  "system_prompt": "...",
  "user_prompt": "...",
  "llm_model_id": "UUID-of-selected-model",
  "llm_config": {
    "temperature": 0.3
  },
  "output_format": {
    "field_1": "str",
    "field_2": "int"
  },
  "image_required": false,
  "input_processors": []
}
```

### Phase 7: Deploy to Rightbrain API

Since we already have credentials from Phase 0, proceed directly to deployment.

**Step 1: Fetch available models**

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest list-models --json
```

Parse the response to find the best model for the task type. Look for:
- `id`: The model UUID to use in `llm_model_id`
- `name`: Human-readable model name
- `supports_vision`: Required for image tasks

**Step 2: Create the task**

Write the complete task configuration to a YAML file, then create it:

```bash
npx rightbrain@latest create-task --file task.yaml --direct
```

**Step 3: Report results**

On success, tell the user:
- Task ID (for future reference)
- Task access token (for running the task)
- How to run the task via API
- Link to view task in dashboard: `https://app.rightbrain.ai/task/{task_id}/run`

On failure, parse the error and help fix it:
- 400 errors: Show validation message, suggest fix
- 400 `duplicate_task_name`: Task name already exists - use unique name (add version suffix like "v2")
- 401 errors: Session expired — re-run `npx rightbrain@latest login`
- 403 errors: Permission issue

**Step 4: Offer to run the task**

Ask if the user wants to test the task immediately. If yes, proceed to [Run Task Flow](#run-task-flow).

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Errors

| Status | Cause | Solution |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 400 | Validation error | Check error message, fix input |
| 400 | `duplicate_task_name` | Task name already exists - use unique name |
| 401 | Invalid/expired session | Re-run `npx rightbrain@latest login` to refresh credentials |
| 403 | No permission on resource | Verify access in dashboard |
| 404 | Resource not found | Verify org/project/task IDs are correct |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded | Wait 30 seconds before retrying |
| 500 | Server error | Retry after a few seconds |

### Network Errors

| Error Type | Cause | Solution |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Connection timeout | Network issue or server unreachable | Check internet connection, retry in 10 seconds |
| Connection refused | Server down or wrong URL | Verify API URL is correct, check Rightbrain status |
| SSL/TLS error | Certificate issue | Report to Rightbrain support |
| Empty response | Server returned no data | Retry request, check API status if persistent |

**Retry strategy:** For 429 and 5xx errors, wait and retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (10s, 30s, 60s).

---

## Validation Rules
